## Message to President Trump

This site was built to offer guidance and help as you asked for in your [victory
speech](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/11/08/donald-trump-entire-victory-speech-election-sot.cnn). I truly hope you meant the things you said about unifying our great
nation and that you take these letters to heart.

## About the Creator

I think it is important that we, all people, see each other as real people. I
think online we often forget that we are interacting with real people, and
instead just see each other as
"[liberal clowns](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/622399905441583104)"
or conservative "[deplorables](http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-basket-of-deplorables/)".
But in reality, I think we are more alike then we are different. Everybody wants
to be able to live their life in liberty and pursue what makes them happy. They
want to be treated with respect and to experience love.

I'm a white, male, lower-middle-class, conservative, Christian born and raised
in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon. I grew up visiting my family in rural Idaho,
where I witnessed the vast difference in my life near a small metropolitan city
and their lives there. In many ways I fall into your constituency and I know
many of my family probably voted for you too. I was lucky though, my parents
took out loans, along with my own student loans in order for me to go to
college.

In fact, I was a fan of your show Celebrity Apprentice, and when I watched your
[announcement speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_q61B-DyPk) the morning
of June 16th, 2015. As Ivanka talked on stage and announced your candidacy, I
was excited; I was ready to vote for you. Of course there were several moments
in your speech that I didn't agree with, but in general I heard your message
that American jobs were being lost overseas. I believe that over the last decade
or two, or more, we have let large corporations send jobs overseas to save
money. This has benefitted the corporate elite and devastated the lower middle
class.

I'm fortunate enough that at my lowest point, my wife and newborn daughter and I
lived in a small two bedroom condo owned by my grandmother-in-law. She let us
live their rent-free, we only had to pay the utilities and HOA fees. I was fresh
out of college and had recently lost my job at a sign company. I was lucky to
find another one fairly quickly building websites at a small company. They
couldn't afford health insurance, and neither could I. I made so little that my
wife qualified for WIC and without that she and my daughter would have gone
without critical medical care, while I went uncovered for a long time.

Over the 5 years I was at that company, it was a rocky road, I made some bad
decisions and it ended up costing me greatly. I believe in being fiscally
responsible and living within your means, but we reached a point where we
couldn't afford to pay our bills. My wife had to get a full-time job and still
we went into tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt. We borrowed money
from family just to get by. We were lucky that we had family support. I know
most others in similar situations are not that lucky.

So I think I have a good idea why approximately half of the country is upset
with the way their lives have been. Today I'm fortunate enough to have found a
great job for a great company, we were able to pay off our credit card debt and
we were able to save enough to buy a house.

I never wanted to vote for Hillary Clinton, but I did. Why? Very early on I
thought the media was twisting some of your words or focusing on a small part of
them, instead of the overall message. But as the campaign went on, I saw the
division in our country grow even worse, and you seemed to enjoy driving that
wedge even deeper and avoided answering questions that would help mend that gap.
You said even more outrageous things, hurtful things and became a fearmonger.
Most elections are hard, but this seemed to be, more then ever, one of fear,
anger and hate. I had hoped that hate would not win, and I would be writing a
different letter about now. One that let Hillary know why you had such large
appeal, and how she needed to acknowledge the cord you struck with many people.

## Open Letters

Now that you know a little about why I created this site, I would like to point
you to [Letters to you President Trump](/letters/) that myself, and
hopefully others will write to you offering our advice, our guidance. Whether
we voted for you or not, you are the President now, and that means you work for
the good of our country, for the good of all people in it, and we are here to
make sure you live up to that.
